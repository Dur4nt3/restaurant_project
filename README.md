# Restaurant Page Project

### Restaurant Page | The Odin Project | JavaScript

This is the third project of the "JavaScript" course within "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to build a restaurant page with three different tabs that you can switch to.

This app is used to practice modules, and bundling via Webpack (along with subjects introduced in previous projects).

**Skills demonstrated: Bundling with webpack, same-page "tab switching" with JavaScript, ES6 modules**

**Webpage responsiveness: THIS PAGE WILL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY ON MOBILE DEVICES**
