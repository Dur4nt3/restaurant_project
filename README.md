# Restaurant Page Project

### Restaurant Page | The Odin Project | JavaScript

This is the third project of the "JavaScript" course within "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to build a restaurant page with three different tabs that you can switch to.[^1]

This app is used to practice modules, and bundling via Webpack (along with subjects introduced in previous projects).

**Skills demonstrated: Intermediate HTML, Intermediate CSS, Intermediate JavaScript**

**Webpage responsiveness: THIS PAGE WILL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY ON MOBILE DEVICES**

[^1]: Although the goal of the project was to practice ES6 modules and Webpack, I saw it as an opportunity to delve deeper into CSS. Therefore, it's more than likely that I put more effort into the CSS than the project called for (that is, of course, along with accomplishing the goal of practicing ES6 modules and Webpack.)
